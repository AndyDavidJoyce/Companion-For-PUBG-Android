        You will need to provide a Google Maps API key to run this.

        The way I run this is by creating a file called 'local-strings.xml'. The file is NEVER
        added to Git. Inside of it I created a string resource called 'local_maps_api_key', it
        contains the API key from https://console.developers.google.com/apis that will be used.
